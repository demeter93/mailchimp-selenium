This script captures the name, job title, and bio from https://mailchimp.com/about/. It captures this data for all individuals, and exports these three data items to a CSV file.

The script may be run directly in Selenium IDE. If you have Selenium Webdriver configured to run Selenium IDE scripts, it can be utilized that way as well. If using Selenium IDE, the file logging add-on must be configured prior to running the script, by taking the following steps:

1. Install the Selenium IDE file logging add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/file-logging-selenium-ide/.
2. Restart Firefox.
3. Open Selenium IDE. From the "Options" dropdown, select "Options".
4. Select the "FileLogging" tab.
5. Create a blank CSV file and place it in your desired directory. In the FileLogging tab, select the this file as the file logging location.
6. From the "File Logging Level" dropdown, select "Info".
7. Select "OK", and then run the script.
