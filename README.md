This script captures the name, job title, and bio from https://mailchimp.com/about/. It captures this data for all individuals, and exports these three data items to a CSV file.

The script may be run directly in Selenium IDE. If you have Selenium Webdriver configured to run Selenium IDE scripts, it can be utilized that way as well. If using Selenium IDE, the file logging add-on must be configured prior to running the script, by taking the following steps:

1. Install the Selenium IDE file logging add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/file-logging-selenium-ide/.
2. Restart Firefox.
3. Open Selenium IDE. From the "Options" dropdown, select "Options".
4. Selec the "FileLogging" tab.
5. Select the log file location of choice.
6. From the "File Logging Level" dropdown, select "Info".
7. Select "OK", and then run the script.
